# COVIDCounts

Hi! Going forward I am utilizing the dataset with "(Data)" on the end (far easier to refresh than the original version).

COVID19Tracker.ca has provided a ton of data-points for this view! 

Supply schedule is based on the latest from Canada.ca (currently has until mid-April).

Sharing an output on Tableau (and sometimes on Twitter), have a look over there and suggest any improvements. :)

Ontario daily administrations forecast: Has not yet fully considered supply/distribution improvements but rather continues the recent day-to-day % lifts (Sunday reverts to WoW)

Canada forecast: Currently carries forward the previous weeks administrations (hoping to apply a one-size-fits-all approach)

(Work-in-progress)
